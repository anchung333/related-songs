# related-songs
This was a project I worked on while at Hack Reactor. I was on a team with 2 other engineers, and we were tasked with implementing a clone of a popular service; in our case we chose Soundcloud. I was in charge of the related songs service, where a user can see 3 songs related to the main song currently displayed/playing on the page, and use their mouse to hover over songs and learn more about the artist, and play the song from that same page.

## Technologies
- React
- Node.js/Express
- Docker
- AWS
- MongoDB
- Jest
- Google Lighthouse

## Goal: 
 - Build an app that simulates a single page experience in a service oriented style where each service is responsible for delivering the content + data for one module on the page. The modules will be linked together on a proxy-server and all modules must coordinate and work together to present content for a given item ID or item name. Each team member will build their own proxy server that consumes their module and all of their teammates' modules.
